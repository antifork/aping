- libc_reentrant bug in OPENBSD 3.0 3.1!!!

- Termios and no canonical mode input processing (VIM,VTIME) dont work 
  properly with reentrant version of getc(), getchar() and even read().
  The timeout set by the VTIME of c_cc array is ignored and the call blocks 
  until a charapter is available for reading.
  By disabling the keyboard signals, with ~ISIG bit in c_iflag field, it is 
  possible for reentrant getc() to read the combination ctrl+c instead of 
  being signaled. 
 
  In this way ctrl+c drives aping to close in the correct manner.
