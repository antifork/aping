Abstract

   In this document we define two new ICMP message types. These new
   types of ICMP messages can be used as probe packets to support a
   variety of measurement applications.  This draft gives detailed
   definition and format of these two new ICMP message types. It is in
   full conformance with the original RFC on ICMP [1], and complements
   the work of the IPPM working group [6][7][8]. The extension of ICMP
   for one-way traffic measurement is also useful for traffic
   engineering.


1. Introduction

   The Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) allows hosts/routers to

Internet Draft   ICMP Extension for One-Way Performance         Aug 2000


   send error or control messages to other hosts/routers. ICMP provides
   communication between the Internet Protocol software on one machine
   and the Internet Protocol software on another[4]. ICMP is considered
   a required part of IP and must be included in every IP
   implementation.  Although ICMP messages are encapsulated and sent
   using IP, ICMP is NOT considered a higher level protocol than IP.


2.  One-Way Performance Metrics

   One-way performance metrics such as one-way delay and one-way loss
   are useful in many situations. Unfortunately, the current ICMP
   messages do not accommodate format that would facilitate such
   measurements. ICMP messages type 15 and 16, information request and
   information reply messages, are now considered obsolete and should
   NOT be implemented by hosts [2]. In this document, we propose adding
   two message types that would enable one-way measurements.


3.  Backward Compatibility

   ICMP extensions proposed in this document MUST be backward compatible
   with the syntax described in RFC-792 [1].


4.  Probe Request and Reply


   The ICMP messages types are listed below in table 1.

   As described in [1], all ICMP messages begin with the same 3 fields:
   Type field (8 bits), Code field (8 bits) and Checksum field (16
   bits).

   The type field indicates the type of the message. Its value
   determines the format of the remaining data.

   The code field depends on the message type. It is used to create an
   additional level of message granularity.

   The checksum field is used to detect data corruption in the entire
   ICMP message.

   IP Fields:

   Addresses

      The address of the source in a probe request message MUST be
      the destination of the probe reply message.  To form a probe
      reply message, the source and destination addresses are simply
      reversed, the type value changed to 42, and the checksum
      recomputed.

   ICMP Fields:

   Type

      41 for probe request message;

      42 for probe reply message.

   Code

      0  for probe data;
      1  for clear;
      2  for clear acknowledgement.

   Checksum

      The checksum is the 16-bit ones's complement of the one's
      complement sum of the entire ICMP message starting with the
      ICMP Type field. For computing the checksum, the checksum
      field should be first set to zero.

   Identifier

      An identifier to aid in matching probe replies to probe
      requests. The identifier of a probe reply is
      obtained from the invoking probe request.

   Description



Elwalid et al.              Expires Jan 2001                    [Page 4]

Internet Draft   ICMP Extension for One-Way Performance         Aug 2000


      The identifier may be used by the sender to aid in matching the
      replies with the requests. For example, the identifier might be
      used like a port in TCP or UDP to identify a session. The
      destination returns these same values in the reply.

      The data received (a probe) in the probe request message is
      returned in the probe reply together with additional
      information on receive timestamp and destination sequence
      number.

      All timestamps are 64 bits. The current time is expressed
      in elapsed seconds and microseconds since 00:00 Universal
      Coordinated Time, January 1, 1970. The resolution of the system
      clock is hardware dependent; the time may be updated
      continuously or in clock ticks.

      The Originate Timestamp is the time the sender last touches the
      message before sending it, the Receive Timestamp is the time
      the receiver first touches the message on receipt.
      The first four octets record the time in seconds, and the next
      four octets give the microseconds granularity.

      The source encodes a Source Sequence Number to notify the
      destination how many probe packets have been transmitted by the
      source. The destination encodes a destination Sequence Number
      to notify the source how many probe packets have been received
      by the destination.

      If the time is not available in microseconds or cannot be
      provided with respect to midnight UT then any time can be
      inserted in a timestamp provided the high order bit of the
      timestamp is also set to indicate this non-standard value.

      ICMP message type 41 and 42 SHOULD be implemented in all internet
      hosts to support one-way traffic measurement.

      The delay of a packet on any route can be obtained by transmitting
      an ICMP probe request packet from the source to the destination.
      The ICMP probe request packet is timestamped at the source at
      time t1 and recorded at the destination at time t2. Then (t2-t1)
      is the total delay adjusted with the time difference between the
      source clock and destination clock. For applications which
      synchronization is needed, estimation of one-way delay may be done
      based on [9][10]. Network Time Protocol is defined in [11] and is
      beyond the scope of this document. The specific synchronization
      technique which determines the accuracy of the measurement is
      beyond the scope of this document.

      When an ICMP probe reply packet returns, the source is able to
      estimate the one-way packet loss rate based on the two
      sequence numbers encoded in the ICMP probe reply packet. The
      detailed procedure is included in Appendix 1. The mechanism is
      intended to combat against losses and re-ordering in the reverse
      channel. It is recommended that if responses are reordered, then
      the sender uses the most recent response; that is, the response
      with the higher "x" value.

   This memo presents no security considerations beyond those that have
   been presented by current ICMP applications.

   If an endpoint (sender or receiver) wants to terminate the
   measurement phase and clears its state, it sends an ICMP packet with
   Code = 1.  Upon receiving this, the recipient is obligated to
   acknowledge this with Code = 2. This exchange should be reliable in
   the sense that the endpoint keeps re-transmitting, if neccessary,
   until it receives the acknowledgement.

   Sender behavior:
       0. Create ICMP control block and set Source_Sequence_Number = 1.
       1. Send an ICMP Request with Originate_Timestamp = t1.
       2. Set an inter-probe interval timer.
       3. If receive a Reply with Source_Sequence_Number = x, and
           Destination_Sequence_Number = y,
                   updates one-way packet loss to 1 - y / x.
       4. If receive a Reply with Code = 1
                   Clear control block, if any.
                   Acknowledge with Code = 2
                   Go to 7.
       5. If measurement is completed,
                   # clear measurement
                   Send ICMP Request with Code = 1
                   and wait for an acknowledgement.
                   Re-transmit until the ack is received.
                   Go to 7.
       6. If the inter-probe interval timer expires,
                   Increment Source_Sequence_Number.
                   Go to 1.
       7. Clear control block and done.

   Receiver behavior:
       1. Receive an ICMP Request.
       2. If (Code = 1)
                   Clear control block, if any.
                   Acknowledge with Code = 2                 Go to 5.
       3. If <Source_IP, Dest_IP, Identifier> is not found,
                   # this is the first packet in the train
                   Create an ICMP control block.
                   Set Destination_Sequence_Number to 1.
                   S <- Source_Sequence_Number.
                   Send an ICMP Reply with Receive_Timestamp = t2.
                   Set a timer for the control block
                   Clear control block if timer expires

           Else      # this is the succeding packet
                   If (Source_Sequence_Number > S)
                          S <- Source_Sequence_Number.
                          Increment Destination_Sequence_Number
                          Send an ICMP Reply with Receive_Timestamp =

   t2.
                   Else

                         # clear measurement
                         Send ICMP Reply with Code = 1
                         and wait for an acknowledgement.
                         Re-transmit until the ack is received.
                         Clear control block
